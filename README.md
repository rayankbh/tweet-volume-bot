### Overview 
With an ever-growing "FinTwit" community, Twitter has become a beacon of daily financial information exchange
between people all across the world. This twitter bot was created to report the hourly tweet volume of specific 
hash/cash-tags, such as [#BTC] or [$GOOG] . I hope that the data provided by this bot provides an interesting 
metric to guage stock popularity/discussion on Twitter. The program also creates and saves a descending horizontal 
bar graph for data visualization. 

### Purpose
The overall purpose of this bot is to provide an interesting metric for popular stocks and cryptocurrencies by providing real-time data on the volume of tweets, accessed via the Twitter API.
