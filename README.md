# tweet-volume-bot

## Follow at: @TweetBotCounter

### Overview 
With an ever-growing "FinTwit" community, Twitter has become a beacon of daily financial information exchange between people all across the world. This twitter bot was created to report the hourly tweet volume of specific hash/cash-tags, such as [#BTC] or [$GOOG] . I hope that the data provided by this bot provides an interesting metric to gauge stock popularity/discussion on Twitter. The program also creates and saves a descending horizontal bar graph for data visualization. 



### Purpose
The overall purpose of this bot is to provide an interesting metric for popular stocks and cryptocurrencies by providing real-time data on the volume of tweets, accessed via the Twitter API. 



### Personal
For me, this project was a fun application and learning opportunity of important Python concepts, API interaction, and increased my familiarity with modules like numpy, matplotlib, and tweepy. 



## What You'll Need
This project was created using Python 3.10. To get started, make sure to install all necessary modules. It is imperative to install the version of Tweepy that cooresponds to your python version. 


### Twitter API Access
To run this bot, you will need a twitter developer account and uniquely generated API access tokens. To apply with your Twitter account, visit: https://developer.twitter.com/en.
